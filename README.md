# leetcode-rust

Welcome to the **leetcode-rust** repository! This project contains solutions to various LeetCode problems implemented in the Rust programming language. Each solution is accompanied by test cases to verify its correctness. The repository is organized into different categories and individual problem directories, making it easy to navigate and find specific solutions.

## Repository Structure

- **study/**: Contains subdirectories for different problem categories (e.g., `array`, `dynamic_programming`). Each category folder includes problem-specific implementations.
- **problems/**: Each folder represents a specific LeetCode problem, identified by its problem number and a brief description. These folders contain the Rust implementation of the solution.
- **util/**: Utility functions and macros that are used across different problem solutions, such as linked list utilities.
